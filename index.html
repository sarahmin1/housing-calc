      <p>Saddled with student loan debt and facing the rising prices of mortgages, American college graduates are finding it increasingly difficult to save up for their own homes. That difficulty is particularly acute in New York City, where the average
        student loan debt per capita in the state is among the highest in the nation.</p>

      <p>New York has one of the highest student loan debt per capita in the nation with $5,570, which is $650 more than the national average of $4,920.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, household debt climbed to a five-year high in 2017, increasing $193 billion to reach $13.15 trillion. Mortgage balances rose 1.6 percent and student loans rose 1.5 percent in the last quarter of 2017.</p>

      <p>“New York City has one of the highest taxes I think for homes. So I don’t think that would be possible in a city such as New York City,” said Sasha Cabrera, 27. “Maybe like down in another state like Florida, North Carolina something like that but,
        I don’t think it is doable unless you have a really good job that pays you a lot of money.“</p>

      <p>Student debt forces young people to delay major life milestones, such as delaying marriage or saving up for retirement. Of 1,500 people surveyed in a 2016 report by Consumer Reports, 28 percent said that they delayed buying a house. Forty-five percent
        of college graduates said they felt that college was not worth the cost.</p>

      <p>And the increasing debt is taking a psychological toll on college graduates. A Student Loan Hero survey in 2017 reported that more than half of respondents experienced headaches, muscle tension and upset stomach due to student loan related financial
        anxiety.
      </p>

      <p>At 33 percent, borrowers in their 30s hold the largest percentage of student loan balances, which amounted to $408.4 billion in 2015. That is $32.1 billion more than what the under-30 group owes, which is $376.3 billion. Borrowers in their 40s,
        however, have halved their balance to $229.6 billion.</p>
