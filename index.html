      <div class="text">

        <p>Saddled with student loan debt and facing the rising prices of mortgages, American college graduates are finding it increasingly difficult to save up for their own homes. That difficulty is particularly acute in New York City, which is one of
          the most unaffordable markets in the country.</p>

        <p>“New York City has one of the highest taxes I think for homes. So I don’t think that would be possible in a city such as New York City,” said Sasha Cabrera, 27. “Maybe like down in another state like Florida, North Carolina something like that
          but, I don’t think it is doable unless you have a really good job that pays you a lot of money.“</p>

        <p>Home prices in New York have been rising consistently in recent months, increasing over 6 percent in the past year, and mortgage rates have recently begun an uphill climb as well. While people selling their current home before buying a new one
          will get some benefit from these higher prices, people buying homes for the first time are squeezed out.</p>

        <p>“Incomes are just not keeping up with prices, which makes saving for a home difficult for anyone,” said Robert Brusca, an economist who focuses on the housing market at Fact and Opinion Economics, a Manhattan-based consulting firm. “Younger people,
          people who already have other types of debt, end up facing the sting of those affordability issues the most.”</p>

        <p>New York has one of the highest student loan debt per capita in the nation with $5,570, which is $650 more than the national average of $4,920.</p>

        <p>Student debt forces young people to delay major life milestones, such as delaying marriage or saving up for retirement. Of 1,500 people surveyed in a 2016 report by Consumer Reports, 28 percent said that they delayed buying a house. Forty-five
          percent of college graduates said they felt that college was not worth the cost.</p>

        <p>And the increasing debt is taking a psychological toll on college graduates. A Student Loan Hero survey in 2017 reported that more than half of respondents experienced headaches, muscle tension and upset stomach due to student loan related financial
          anxiety.
        </p>

        <p>“It is difficult paying so much money in student loans and other expenses that I have, because the money that I earn is sometimes not enough for bills,” said Cabrera.</p>
