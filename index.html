      <div class="text">

        <p>Saddled with student loan debt and facing the rising prices of mortgages, American college graduates are finding it increasingly difficult to save up for their own homes. That difficulty is particularly acute in New York City, where the average
          student loan debt per capita in the state is among the highest in the nation.</p>

        <p>New York has one of the highest student loan debt per capita in the nation with $5,570, which is $650 more than the national average of $4,920.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, household debt climbed to a five-year high in 2017, increasing $193 billion to reach $13.15 trillion. Mortgage balances rose 1.6 percent and student loans rose 1.5 percent in the last quarter of 2017.</p>

        <p>“New York City has one of the highest taxes I think for homes. So I don’t think that would be possible in a city such as New York City,” said Sasha Cabrera, 27. “Maybe like down in another state like Florida, North Carolina something like that
          but, I don’t think it is doable unless you have a really good job that pays you a lot of money.“</p>

        <p>Student debt forces young people to delay major life milestones, such as delaying marriage or saving up for retirement. Of 1,500 people surveyed in a 2016 report by Consumer Reports, 28 percent said that they delayed buying a house. Forty-five
          percent of college graduates said they felt that college was not worth the cost.</p>

        <p>For many young New Yorkers, the burden of student debt comes on top of a housing market that has been increasingly unfriendly to first-time home buyers. New York City is currently one of the most unaffordable markets in the country, and home prices
          in the city have been rising consistently in recent months.</p>

        <p>In New York, home prices rose over 6 percent in the past year, and mortgage rates have recently begun an uphill climb as well. While people selling their current home before buying a new one get some benefit from these higher prices, people buying
          homes for the first time are squeezed out.</p>

        <p>“Incomes are just not keeping up with prices, which makes saving for a home difficult for anyone,” said Robert Brusca, an economist who focuses on the housing market at Fact and Opinion Economics, a Manhattan-based consulting firm. “Younger people,
          people who already have other types of debt, end up facing the sting of those affordability issues the most.”</p>

        <p>And the increasing debt is taking a psychological toll on college graduates. A Student Loan Hero survey in 2017 reported that more than half of respondents experienced headaches, muscle tension and upset stomach due to student loan related financial
          anxiety.
        </p>

        <p>“It is difficult paying so much money in student loans and other expenses that I have, because the money that I earn is sometimes not enough for bills,” said Cabrera.</p>

        <h2>Can you afford an NYC home?</h2>

        <p>“I think this calculator will help many students who have recently graduated by helping them budget themselves in other areas so that they are able to save money for buying property in the future,” said Sasha Cabrera.</p>

        <p class="small">This calculator doesn't account for inflation.</p>

        <p>The following calculator will help you determine the number of years it will take for someone to afford the average down payment in a borough.</p>
